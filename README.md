# Chrominary
A simple chrome based extension to save (and then later open all at once) the URLs of currently opened tabs. Really helpful when you have opened lots of tabs while searching and would like to go over these or save these at once for future reference.

# Loading the extension

0. First clone or download the repo and extract(if downloaded as zip)
1. Go to chrome://extensions
2. Enable the Developer mode
3. Click Load unpacked extension
4. Select the cloned or extracted directory(which directly contains manifest.json file inside)
5. Thats all ! Now you should have a small 'U' icon at the upper right corner. Click that when you want to save the pages. Given it some name and done !
